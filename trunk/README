This is the source code for the CUSUMMA implementation. It is provided without warranty of any kind.

Notes:
This is still very much under development, so there are some rough spots. Most notably is the lack 
of makefile, which will be added soon. For now this code simply be dropped into an existing project
and incorporated, requireing only that the CUBLAS library is included in the call to nvcc (-lcublas).

Future Work:
- Flesh out documentation
- Add support for double and complex data types
- Implement multi-GPU aware version

Cheers,
Byron
